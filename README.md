QUESTION  1

/*
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
/*
1. function studentmark.
2. marks is the parameter.
3. the code block "using if, else and else if to execute the marks conditions.
4. return used to give the output as alert allows us to print a message(in this case a grade), to the output.
5. user is prompted to enter the student marks inorder for the output to be generated



QUESTION 2

Challenge 2.Speed Detector (Toy Problem)



Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.



1. speedread function  determines the speed limit.
2. declaring the variable speed.
3. speed prompt.
4. the code block -using **if, else and else if to execute the speed conditions**.
5. console.log is used for the output.
